## Gameplay

A two player co-op game, with elements of a classic 2d platformer game.
Both players have to reach a special glowing spot on the map (the 'comet') to
complete the level. To do so, they have to create blocks out of thin air -
which unfortunately makes another block somewhere else on the map vanish.

## Technical details
- Javascript/HTML5 browser game, using http://phaser.io/ (http://www.pixijs.com/)
- Controls : keyboard and/or gamepads (online demo only keyboard control)
